# Auto-Lending-Insurance-Analytics
Analysis of auto lending and insurance data, including key insights, predictive modeling, and business recommendations.


# Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of auto lending and insurance data, focusing on trends, predictive modeling, and business recommendations. The project explores premium and claim trends, credit risk assessment, delinquency prediction, and telematics integration to optimize decision-making in the auto finance and insurance industries.

# Key Insights
Premium & Claim Trends:
Premiums steadily declined from 2018 to 2020, while claims fluctuated.
A sudden drop in claims in 2019, followed by an increase in 2020, indicates economic and policy shifts.
Credit Risk Analysis:
Super-prime borrowers dominate loan volumes, while subprime lending remains limited.
A strong negative correlation between delinquency proxy and lending tightness suggests that stricter policies reduce default risks.
Predictive Modeling:
Random Forest and Linear Regression were used to predict insurance premiums and classify claim risk.
Credit scoring models weighted income levels, inquiry index, and debt-to-income ratio for risk assessment.
Telematics Integration:
Leveraging telematics data can improve insurance pricing and help lenders assess borrower risk.

# Business Recommendations
For Auto Insurance Companies:
✔️ Implement risk-based pricing based on claim severity and historical trends.
✔️ Use fraud detection algorithms to minimize claim payouts.
✔️ Integrate telematics to track driving behavior and offer discounts for safer driving.

For Auto Lenders:
✔️ Strengthen credit risk assessment with borrower profiling and real-time analytics.
✔️ Introduce flexible repayment options to reduce delinquencies.
✔️ Develop secured auto loans for subprime borrowers with risk-mitigation measures.

# Future Enhancements
Incorporate real-time macroeconomic indicators to refine predictions.
Expand analysis with deep learning models for risk prediction.
Pilot telematics-based policies and measure their impact.
